Welcome to the Warehouse coding exercise.

The idea of this task is to provide us with more details about your general coding skills.
We would like to discuss your solution during the technical interview, so please send us your solution at least 2 days before your scheduled interview.

In the Warehouse folder you can find the Java Maven project that could be imported to your favorite IDE.
It is a basic project that simulates assets warehouse where a user can perform some basic operations via API.
Assets could be uniquely identified by a serial number.

We have created an acceptance test file for you - com.example.warehouse.WarehouseApiTest. Currently all tests are failing.
We would like to ask you to make all tests in this file to pass.

Please do not modify tests in com.example.warehouse.WarehouseApiTest file.
You can move this class to different package or edit setUp() method, only do not edit tests methods.

You can modify any other classes, add new classes, add necessary libraries, etc. It is your decision on how you will solve this.
Please pay attention to code quality, tests, good coding practices, etc. - consider your code as production one.

We would like to respect your time, so please do not spent on this task too much time.

Last but not least - please do not use an external database for storing assets. Just plain Java in any version.

Good luck and have fun!
